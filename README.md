!! NOT FINISHED !!
This game was created and designed to teach cyber security principles in a simple way. 

RULES:
Two users play against each other trying to attack the others servers while defending their own. 
At the start of each turn users can either attack if they have an attack available (Full Red Circle), or skip and draw.
On a draw users have the possibility of earning an attack, a firewall for their servers, or a special two factor authentifcation shield.
The goal is to earn and use enough attacks to destroy all of the enemies servers.

This game was made with the capability to implement a machine learning AI enemy to play against.
